## Introduction:

Online shopping has become more popular, people love to shop online since it is faster and convenient. It is easier to compare prices and research products. You can save yourself time and gas and not have to wait in long lines. All it takes is your phone/computer and your card and you can happily shop online. We are going to look at customer's shopping behaviors from data that I found on Kaggle. We will take a look into specific information like on what people shop for or their prefered season. 

The data I am working with is from Kaggle.
*https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/customer-shopping-trends-dataset*
The data is made from Sourav Banerjee, who collected the data about a year ago, to explore shopping trends and get a better understand of data analysis.

```

## 2) Average people spent per season
```{r}
ggplot(Shopping_Trends_Data %>% 
  group_by(Season) %>% 
  summarise(mean(Purchase.Amount..USD.))) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Season, fill = Season))

```

---

## 3) Color most purchased per season
```{r}
ggplot()

Shopping_Trends_Data %>% 
  group_by(Season) %>% 
  summarise(Num_of_Colors = mode(Color))
```
